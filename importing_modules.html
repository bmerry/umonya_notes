		<h2>The import Statement</h2>

		<p>We have already learnt the basics of programming. We have all the
		tools we will ever need to solve any problem we can solve in our heads.
		But many times we will find ourselves reinventing the wheel. Either a
		wheel we've made ourselves, e.g. writing the same piece of code over
		and over again in different programs, or even a wheel someone else has
		made, e.g. solving a problem someone else has already solved. The point
		is the code has already been written, and what we want is a convenient
		way to package it so that we can use it without rewriting it. And thus
		the <a class="doclink"
		href='http://docs.python.org/tut.node8.html'>module</a> was born.</p>

		<p>Modules allow us to write code, and separate it out from other code
		into a different file, known as a module. We can use the <strong>import
		statement</strong> to include the code of another file, either in the
		current directory, or in python's <strong>search path</strong>, in
		place. What this means is that the file is loaded and run as if its
		code had been in the place of the import statement. As such, any
		statements in the file are executed, including function definitions,
		class definitions, assignments, etc.</p>

		<pre class='definition'>
import &lt;module_name&gt;
</pre>

		<p>'module_name' is the name of a Python file without the '.py'
		extension. Any Python program can be imported as a module, although
		most often modules contain function definitions and a minimum of
		initialisation code, allowing us to keep commonly used function
		definitions in a place where they can be reused without rewriting them,
		and more importantly collecting function definitions that are related,
		e.g. all database functions, together and separate from our main
		code.</p>

		<h2>Namespaces</h2>

		<p>If we have a Python file which we wish to import, that has a global
		variable 'i', into our main program, also with a global variable 'i',
		there could be some confusion. The module's 'i' variable is in the
		global scope of the module, but where is it in the scope of the program
		as a whole? Python solves this problem with the introduction of
		namespaces. Formally, a module when imported introduces its own scope
		block, called the module scope. <strong>It is a global scope in its own
		right</strong>.  Variables within a modules global scope are forcibly
		kept separate from their super-programs, or super-modules (i.e. those
		programs or modules that import them). The global statement does not
		allow variables references or assignment to cross module scope
		boundaries. Instead all names (variables, functions, or classes) are
		created within a module's 'namespace', meaning they must be explicitly
		referenced from without the module by first naming the module itself,
		as in</p>

		<pre class='definition'>
&lt;module_name&gt;.&lt;symbol_name&gt;
</pre>

		<p>Where symbol is the name of a variable assigned a value, a function
		defined, of a class defined.</p>

		<pre class='listing'>
#my_module.py

i = 2
</pre>

		<pre class='listing'>
#main.py
i = 1

import my_module.py
print i
print my_module.i

print "---"

my_module.i = 3
print i
print my_module.i
</pre>

		<p>Running main.py produces the following output</p>

		<pre class='listing'>
1
2
---
1
3
</pre>

		<p>Despite the fact that 'i' is assigned the value of 2 in my_module.py
		<strong>after</strong> it is assigned the value of 1 in main.py, since
		the import statement executes that assignment after the initial
		assignment, the value of 'i' in main.py is not changed. As we can see,
		the two 'i's are kept completely separate. From main.py, if we wish to
		reference the 'i' in my_module.py, we must do explicitly, using the
		module name, <code>my_module.i</code>. We also see that we can assign a
		value to a variable in a module's namespace, using the same syntax.</p>

		<h2>The dir function</h2>

		<pre class='definition'>
dir(&lt;object&gt;)
</pre>

		<p>The dir function is a built in function that takes one parameter,
		and lists all the attributes of the object given. Methods, properties,
		and variables are all considered attributes. If this isn't making sense
		to you yet, don't worry, we will cover it all in the sections on object
		oriented programming. What we need to know now, is that although the
		dir function is not very helpful in a program, it is <strong>incredibly
		useful</strong> when using the Python interactive interpreter. As
		modules are objects in python, in fact everything is an object, we can
		call dir on a module at obtain a list of everything in the module that
		can be referenced with the dot notation
		(<code>&lt;module_name&gt;.&lt;attribute&gt;</code>).</p>

		<pre class='listing'>
&gt;&gt;&gt; import my_module
&gt;&gt;&gt; dir(my_module)
['__builtins__', '__doc__', '__file__', '__name__', 'i']
&gt;&gt;&gt;
</pre>

		<p>In the example, we import my_module.py (from above), and run 'dir'
		on it. We are returned a list containing some stuff we expect, namely
		the 'i', which is a variable assigned a value within the module
		my_module, and some stuff we don't expect; <code>['__builtins__',
		'__doc__', '__file__', '__name__']</code>. Short of delving into both
		object oriented programming and exception handling all at once, these
		elements cannot be easily explained now, and are not especially
		important to us.</p>

		<h2>The locals and globals Functions</h2>

		<p>Of more direct use to use whilst programming, are the locals and
		globals functions. Both take no parameters, and both return
		dictionaries. <code>globals()</code> returns a dictionary of objects
		available in the global scope, whilst <code>locals()</code> does the
		same but for the local scope. The practical use of this is we can make
		even the names of our variables dynamic, i.e. the ability to use a
		variable ('a') to store another variable's ('b') name, by using 'a' as
		a key into the dictionary returned by either locals, or globals.</p>

		<pre class='listing'>
#!/usr/bin/python

#ask the user for a variable name
vname = input("Enter a variable name: ")

#ask the user for a value
value = input("Enter a value for %s: "%vname)
locals()[vname] = value

print "vname: ", vname
print "locals()[vname]: ", locals()[vname]
print "value: ", value

#assume the user inputted bob
print "bob: ", bob
</pre>

		<p>Outputs the following when 'bob' is entered as a variable name, and
		4 as a value. Not how 'bob' becomes available as a normal variable
		name, as seen in the last line, once it has been added to the locals()
		dictionary.</p>

		<pre class='listing'>
Enter a variable name: bob
Enter a value for bob: 4
vname:	bob
locals()[vname]:	4
value:	4
bob: 4
</pre>

		<h2>An Overview of Selected Standard Modules</h2>

		<p>Ultimately, the true use of modules, is to get other people to do
		the work for us. We are programmers, and thus laziness a virtue, after
		all. The comprehensive list of standard Python modules, i.e. modules
		that come with a standard install of the latest version (currently
		2.5), can be found <a class="doclink"
		href='http://docs.python.org/modindex.html'>here</a>. Of particular
		interest to us, by virtue of their usage most common, are</p>

		<dl>

			<dt>math</dt>

			<dd>Provides various non-basic mathematical functions, <i>inter
			alia</i>: trigonometric functions, hyperbolic functions, exponent
			and logarithm functions, and mathematical constants (e.g. pi and
			e)</dd>

			<dt>random</dt>

			<dd>Provides various methods of choosing random numbers, or making
			random choices from sequences, using a variety of statistical
			distributions.</dd>

			<dt>os</dt>

			<dd>Provides multitudinous operating system related functions,
			primarily file and process management functions.</dd>

			<dt>sys</dt>

			<dd>Provides a large number of variables and functions dealing with
			the internals of the Python interpreter itself, and the environment
			in which it was invoked. Specific uses of various sys variables are
			discussed shortly.</dd>

			<dt>time</dt>

			<dd>Provides various functions for obtaining the current time, and
			manipulating variables that store values representing time.</dd>

		</dl>

		<h2>The sys Module</h2>

		<p>The sys module is quite extensive, but by far the most useful
		aspects of it are access to what are known as the <strong>standard
		streams</strong>, and the processes command line arguments. When a
		program is run from the command line, for example python, we can pass
		the program itself parameters, as if it were a function. In operating
		system shell speak they are known as arguments. We pass an argument to
		python to tell it what Python file to run,</p>

		<pre class='listing'>
sirlark@hephaestus ~ $ Python my_file.py
</pre>

		<p>We can actually pass any number of arguments to a program we run
		from the command line, each separated by some amount of white space. If
		white space is enclosed in quotes of some kind, it does not separate
		arguments, but rather is included within one command line argument. In
		python's case, arguments that come after the specification of the
		filename to run are passed through to the program being run as its own
		command line arguments.</p>

		<div class="syncode">
			sirlark@hephaestus ~ $ Python my_prog.py <strong>somefile.fasta 7 "ACCTGT AGTCA"</strong>
		</div>

		<p>In the example above, the program my_prog.py receives three command
		line arguments, namely 'somefile.fasta', '7', and 'ACCTGT AGTCA'. Note
		the space within the sequence snippet, and the fact that the 7 is in
		quotes and thus a string.</p>

		<p>So now we have a really convenient way of passing small amounts of
		input into our programs, instead of prompting the user with input
		calls all the time. Command line arguments are especially useful for
		the purposes of specifying filenames and options the influence how our
		program processes data, and preferable to input statements for two
		reasons. First, when entering filenames, command line arguments allow
		the user to use shell expansions and tab completions. Second, our
		program can be run without user intervention if it's likely to take a
		long time to run, e.g. the user can specify a number of files to
		process on the command line (probably using a '*.fasta' or similar) and
		walk away. Assuming each file would take 20 or more minutes to process,
		if we were using input statements to prompt for the next file, if
		the user came back the next morning, our program would have processed
		the first file, and be waiting for the entry of the second filename.
		Command line arguments avoid this issue neatly.</p>

		<p>But how, in python, do we access what command line arguments have
		been given to our program. Well, the sys module provides a list called
		'argv' (for argument vector), which contains as its elements the
		command line arguments passed to our program, in order. Examine the
		following simple program. Run it a few times providing different
		command line arguments each time, and test it with quoted arguments
		containing spaces or tabs.</p>

		<pre class='listing'>
#!/usr/bin/python
#commargs.py

#import the sys module
import sys

#print out our command line arguments
print sys.argv
</pre>

		<pre class='listing'>
sirlark@hephaestus ~/scratch $ Python commargs.py Hello
['commargs.py', 'Hello']
sirlark@hephaestus ~/scratch $ Python commargs.py Hello There
['commargs.py', 'Hello', 'There']
sirlark@hephaestus ~/scratch $ Python commargs.py "Hello There"
['commargs.py', 'Hello There']
sirlark@hephaestus ~/scratch $ Python commargs.py "Hello There" 47
['commargs.py', 'Hello There', '47']
sirlark@hephaestus ~/scratch $
</pre>

		<p>Note how the first element of <code>sys.argv</code> is always the
		name of our Python program. Where after the arguments are those we gave
		on the command line. Also note how all the elements, even the 47, are
		in fact strings.</p>

		<h2>The Standard Streams</h2>

		<p>Whenever a Python program is run, it opens three files
		automatically, called standard input (stdin), standard output (stdout),
		and standard error (stderr). Generally these files represent keyboard
		input, screen output, and error output respectively, but they can be
		<strong>redirected</strong> causing the input to our program to come
		from the output of another, for example, as when used in a shell pipe
		('|'). Similarly our programs output could be redirected to a file, or
		piped into the input of another process. However, all these effects are
		transparent to us ... the print statement actually writes to stdout,
		the input function reads from stdin. If we want to write to stderr
		however, we must do so explicitly. The three standard streams are all
		accessible via the sys module as</p>

		<ul>

			<li><code>sys.stdin</code>: standard input</li>

			<li><code>sys.stdout</code>: standard output</li>

			<li><code>sys.stderr</code>: standard error. This stream exists to
			differentiate error output from normal output, so that we can use
			the shell to split off errors from processes executed in large
			batches, and not have to deal with all the normal output they
			produce. This stream is usually outputted to the screen, unless it
			has been redirected, which means that programs can generally issue
			error messages to the screen even if their normal output has been
			redirected.</li>

		</ul>

		<p>Each of these are file objects, so sys.stdin, which is opened only
		for reading, has the usual <code>.read</code>, <code>.readline</code>,
		and <code>.readlines</code> methods, whilst the other two, stdout and
		stderr, being opened only for writing have the <code>.write</code> and
		<code>.writelines</code> methods available. Here's an example of how to
		use stdout and stderr to split output effectively.</p>

<pre class='listing'>#!/usr/bin/python

import sys

#get a line of input from the user
print "Please enter a phrase: "	#this gets sent to stdout
phrase = sys.stdin.readline()	#this gets read from stdin

if phrase.isdigits():
    sys.stderr.write("Phrase entered was a number\n")	#this gets sent to stderr
else:
    sys.stdout.write("Phrase contains %i 'a' characters\n"%phrase.count('a'))
</pre>

		<p>There's one more feature of the print statement that now becomes important, namely redirection. We can specify a standard stream (or in fact any file object open for writing) to print to, instead of standard output. The syntax is:</p>

<pre class='definition'>
print &gt;&gt; &lt;file object&gt;, &lt;expression&gt;[, &lt;expression&gt;...]
</pre>

		<p>So the above example could be redone as follows:</p>

<pre class='listing'>#!/usr/bin/python

import sys

#get a line of input from the user
print "Please enter a phrase: "	#this gets sent to stdout
phrase = sys.stdin.readline()	#this gets read from stdin

if phrase.isdigits():
    print >> sys.stderr, "Phrase entered was a number"	#this gets sent to stderr
else:
    print "Phrase contains %i 'a' characters"%phrase.count('a'))
</pre>

		<h2>Exercises</h2>

			<li>When, and why, are command line arguments preferable to taking
			input from the keyboard?</li>

			<li>Can you think of uses for <code>sys.argv[0]</code>? What are they?</li>
