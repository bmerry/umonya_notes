		<h2>Trees in The Wild</h2>

		<p>If we look at a tree in nature, we notice a repeating pattern. The
		trunk of the tree splits off into smaller versions of itself (which we
		call branches). The trunk is a straightish piece of wood, only
		different from a branch by virtue of its direct connection to a root
		system, from which multiple smaller straightish pieces of wood, called
		branches, extend. From each branch, a number of smaller branches may
		extend, and so on and so forth, until branch is eventually small enough
		to be called a twig. We see that a twig has no branches extending off
		it, and also ends in a leaf. We see the repeating pattern is that
		trunks are the same as branches which are the same as twigs. The only
		difference is the number of branches coming off them. And thus we have
		defined the structure of a tree recursively; defined it in smaller
		terms of itself.</p>

		<h2>Trees as a Recursive Data Structure</h2>

		<p>In programming we find many structures imitate that of a tree, such
		that a particular piece of data may contain any number of pieces of
		data of the same structure as itself. We call something having these
		properties a <strong>tree</strong>, after the structure in nature that
		it mimics. Trees in programming consist of <strong>nodes</strong> and
		<strong>edges</strong>. Any node in a tree may <strong>contain</strong>
		any number of <strong>subtrees</strong>, which are edges to another
		node. For example we might represent familial relations with a tree, as
		in</p>

		<div class="centered">
			<img src='images/familytree.png' alt='A Family Tree' class='tree'/>
		</div>

		<p>The node 'grandmother' is the <strong>root</strong> of the tree.
		However, the node 'daughter' is also the root of the subtree whose
		nodes are rectangular. The green shaded nodes are known as <strong>leaf
		nodes</strong> because they have no subtrees.</p>

		<h2>A Python Class to Store Trees</h2>

		<p>Let's create a Python class to represent a tree. We need some way to
		store data in a node, and some way to indicate any child nodes, or
		subtrees.</p>

		<pre class='listing'>
class node(object):
    def __init__(self, value, children = []):
        self.value = value
        self.children = children
</pre>

		<p>Whoa! That seems way too easy... but believe it or not, it does the
		job. Let's use our new class to store our family tree...</p>

		<pre class='listing'>
tree = node("grandmother", [
    node("daughter", [
        node("granddaughter"),
        node("grandson")]),
    node("son", [
        node("granddaughter"),
        node("grandson")])
    ]);
</pre>

		<h2>Traversing a Tree</h2>

		<p>We often find we wish to do something to every node in a tree. We
		may wish to display the data that the nodes contain, to sum the values
		of the nodes in the tree, etc ... We need a method to traverse every
		node in a tree, such that each node is visited exactly once. Well, we
		have a recursive data structure, so we should look at using a recursive
		function to traverse it.</p>

		<p>Of course printing a node object isn't very helpful to us at the
		moment, so let's redefine the '__repr__' method to do something more
		useful...</p>

		<pre class='listing'>
class node(object):
    def __init__(self, value, children = []):
        self.value = value
        self.children = children

    def __repr__(self, level=0):
        ret = "\t"*level+repr(self.value)+"\n"
        for child in self.children:
            ret += child.__repr__(level+1)
        return ret
</pre>

		<p>Now when we <code>print tree</code> we get</p>

		<pre class='listing'>
'grandmother'
    'daughter'
        'granddaughter'
        'grandson'
    'son'
        'granddaughter'
        'grandson'
</pre>

		<p>Here we have used a recursive function for '__repr__'. Our simplest
		case is a leaf node, with no children. We simply return the value of
		the node. In the more complex case, we return the value of the node
		concatenated with the representation of all it's children.</p>

		<p>There are of course two ways to go about traversing a generic tree.
		We can handle each node we encounter before we handle its subtrees,
		known as a <strong>pre-order</strong> traversal, or we can handle the
		subtrees first, and then only the nodes themselves, known as a
		<strong>post-order traversal</strong>. Computer scientists are nothing
		if not original with their naming schemes. Our choice should depend on
		why we are traversing the tree. For the purposes of display, pre-order
		is normally preferred. However for the purposes of producing output in
		a different order, post-order may be more useful, as we'll see when we
		deal with binary trees. There are two more methods of tree traversal,
		namely <strong>in-order</strong> which is primarily only useful in
		binary trees. The other, more generally applicable traversal method, is
		known as a <strong>level-order traversal</strong> where we visit every
		all nodes at a particular level, i.e. distance from the root of the
		whole tree, before progressing to any node of a lower, i.e. further
		from the root, level.</p>

		<p>Pre, post, and in-order traversals are broadly classified as
		<strong>depth-first traversals/searches</strong>, because they dive
		deeper into the structure before moving across to the next child.
		Conversely, the level-order traversal is a <strong>breadth-first
		traversal/search</strong> because it broadens it's search across a
		level before diving deeper down.</p>

		<h2>Binary Trees</h2>

		<p>A binary tree is a special case of a generic tree with additional
		properties.</p>

		<ol>

			<li>Each node may have a maximum of two subtrees, the left subtree
			and the right subtree.</li>

			<li>All values in the left subtree of a node are less than the
			value of the node itself.</li>

			<li>All values in the right subtree of a node are more than the
			value of the node itself.</li>

			<li>The same value cannot appear more than once in the tree.</li>

		</ol>

		<div class="centered">
			<img src='images/binary.png' alt='A Binary Tree' class='tree'/>
		</div>

		<h2>Binary Tree Traversal</h2>

		<p>When dealing with binary trees, the order of traversal makes a huge
		difference, because the binary tree can be considered 'ordered' or
		'sorted'. In-order traversals handle the left sub-tree first, then the
		node, then the right subtree, so starting at the root of our example
		(4), we first progress to the left subtree (2), from whence we visit
		the left subtree again (1), we process 1. Coming back to 2, we process
		the node, i.e. 2. the we process the right subtree (3), which has no
		children. Now we bounce back from 2 to 4, process 4, then move to 4's
		right subtree (6). We then process 6's left subtree (5), then 6 itself,
		then 7. So we see that an in-order traversal of a binary tree gives us
		the values in sorted order.</p>

		<p>Pre-order and post-order traversals can be used to extract different
		orders from the tree, for different purposes. Pre-order traversals are
		best used to display the tree in a nicely formatted way, to make a copy
		of the tree by inserting each visited node. They can also be used to
		evaluate expression trees. Let's take our favorite expression
		(<code>4*(2+3)</code>) and put it in a binary tree, well almost, it
		violates conditions 2, 3 and 4 ... this particular from of tree is
		known as either an <strong>expression tree</strong> or an
		<strong>abstract syntax tree (AST)</strong>.</p>

		<div class="centered">
			<img src='images/ast.png' alt='An Expression Tree' class='tree'/>
		</div>

		<p>Now let's write a class to handle an expression tree. We notice that
		numbers are always leaves, and that that operators always have both a
		left and a right sub-tree. The expression isn't valid if these
		conditions are not true, so our evaluate method makes those assumptions
		and doesn't check for errors. So now we want to do a pre-order
		traversal of the tree, at each node checking if it's an operator, and
		if so, applying that operator to the evaluation of the left tree, and
		the right tree as operands.</p>
		
		<pre class='listing'>
class exprnode(object):
    def __init__(self, value = None, left = None, right = None):
        self.value = value
        self.left = left
        self.right = right
    
    def evaluate(self):
        if self.value == '+':
            return self.left.evaluate() + self.right.evaluate()
        elif self.value == '-':
            return self.left.evaluate() - self.right.evaluate()
        elif self.value == '*':
            return self.left.evaluate() * self.right.evaluate()
        elif self.value == '/':
            return self.left.evaluate() / self.right.evaluate()
        else:
            return self.value

my_expr = exprnode('*',
    exprnode('+',
        exprnode(2),
        exprnode(3)),
    exprnode(4))
    
my_expr.evaluate()
</pre>

		<h2>Finding an Item in a Binary Tree</h2>

		<p>Since no two nodes in a binary tree can have the same value, and we
		know the order in which the nodes are arranged, we can find whether an
		item exists in a binary tree very easily, and very very quickly. If we
		are checking whether some value 'x' is in the tree, we check against
		the root of the tree. If the root is not 'x', then we know x must be in
		the left subtree if 'x' is less then the root, otherwise in the right
		subtree, so we return the search in that subtree. Once again, a quick
		binary tree class, which we will expand as we continue this topic.</p>

		<pre class='listing'>
class binarynode(object):
    def __init__(self, value, left = None, right = None):
        self.value = value
        self.left = left
        self.right = right

    def search(self, value): #returns True if value is in the tree
        if self.value == value:
            return True
        else:
            if value &lt; self.value:
                if self.left != None:
                    return self.left.search(value)
                else:
                    return False
            else:
                if self.right != None:
                    return self.right.search(value)
                else:
                    return False
</pre>

		<h2>Inserting an Item</h2>

		<p>If we want to insert an item into a binary tree, we simply check
		whether there is a subtree to insert it into. If so, we check whether
		it should go to the left or to the right, and recursively call the
		insert function on the subtree. If there is no subtree in the
		appropriate direction, then we simply create a new subtree in the
		correct direction with it's root as our item, and no sub children. The
		only trick that we have to check for, is that we don't find the item
		already in the tree. Here's some code, adding a method to the
		binarynode class...</p>

		<pre class='listing'>
    def insert(self, item):
        if self.value == item:
            return #we do nothing because the item is already here
        else:
            if item &lt; self.value:
                if self.left != None:
                    self.left.insert(item)
                else:
                    self.left = binarynode(item)
            else:
                if self.right != None:
                    self.right.insert(item)
                else:
                    self.right = binarynode(item)
</pre>

		<p>Let's look at insertion using a few diagrams. We wish to insert the
		value 3 into a binary tree containing 1,2,4,5,6, and 7. The red node is
		the one to be inserted, the blue node is the one being processed during
		the particular step.</p>
		
		<script type='text/javascript'>
			animate('bininsert',4,5);
		</script>

		<h2>Removing an Item</h2>

		<p>If we wish to remove an item from a tree, we realise very quickly, that the situation is more complex than an insertion. Removing an item that happens to be a leaf node is trivial. Suppose we have a method of a binarynode that returns None if the
		node's value is the same as the one to delete, otherwise it returns itself. This works ideally in the case of a single node tree. We simply assign the tree to the result of the deletion method.</p>
		<pre class='listing'>
    def delete(self, value):
        if value == self.value:
            return None
        else:
            if value &lt; self.value and self.left != None:
                self.left = self.left.delete(value)
            if value &gt; self.value and self.right != None:
                self.right = self.right.delete(value)
            return self
</pre>

		<p>But this obviously won't work for an <strong>internal node</strong> (i.e. not a leaf node), as we would remove it and all its children from the tree. In this case we must somehow rearrange the tree to adhere to the four conditions of binary trees.
		Conditions two and three are the important ones here. We need to replace the value we are deleting with a value that is greater then every value in the left subtree and less than every value in the right subtree. We also can't add a arbitrary value.
		Which means we have to find a suitable value, and it's pretty obvious which one it's going to be. Well actually we have two choices, a value from the left or a value from the right. We;ll prefer the left, and only choose from the right if there is no
		left. We now want to delete the highest value from the left subtree, and make the value of the deleted node equal to that value, and to delete the highest value from the left. Similarly, we want the lowest value from the right subtree if we are forced
		to go that way. Pretty picture time... We want to delete the value in red from the tree, an each given step we compare the value in red to the value in blue, and make a decision to go left or right. When red equals blue, we follow green to find the
		highest value in the left sub tree, and delete it (which is easy because it's guaranteed to be a leaf node), and replace the blue value with the green value.</p><script type='text/javascript'>
//<![CDATA[
animate('bindel',6,5);
//]]>
</script>

		<p>As we can see this method preserves the integrity of the tree, i.e. all the rules are still in force. Try thinking through the deletion process for '4' in the example tree, and we see it work's for the root node. Now let's write some code...</p>
		<pre class='listing'>
    def highest(self):
        if self.right != None:
            return self.right.highest()
        else:
            return self.value
    
    def lowest(self):
        if self.left != None:
            return self.left.lowest()
        else:
            return self.value
    
    def delete(self, value):
        if value == self.value:
            if self.left != None:
                self.value = self.left.highest()
                self.left.delete(self.value)
            elif self.right != None:
                self.value = self.right.lowest()
                self.right.delete(self.value)
            else:
                return None
        else:
            if value &lt; self.value and self.left != None:
                self.left = self.left.delete(value)
            if value &gt; self.value and self.right != None:
                self.right = self.right.delete(value)
            return self
</pre>

		<p>As a mental exercise, why do we just have to visit the right or left subtrees to find the highest or lowest values in a tree respectively.</p>

		<h2>Balancing a Binary Tree</h2>

		<p>Depending on the order in which values are inserted or deleted from a binary tree, we might <strong>unbalance</strong> the tree. For example, adding every value in order will just give us a long chain of right subtrees, which looks very much like a
		list. In this case we want to <strong>balance</strong> the tree. We define a tree to be unbalanced when the depth of it's left subtree is different from the depth of it's right subtree by more than one. In the case where a tree is unbalanced, we
		rotate right if the depth of the right subtree is less, otherwise left. We keep rotating until the tree is balanced, then we balance the left subtree, then we balance the right subtree.</p>
