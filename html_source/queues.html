		Advanced Data Structures: Queues</h1>

		<h2>First come, First Served</h2>

		<p>We are familiar with the concept of a queue from every bank and
		government department in the world. We go, stand in a line, and are
		served, or dis-served as the case may be, when we reach the front.
		What this implies, is that the order in which people are served, is the
		order in which they join the queue, commonly referred to in English as
		'First come, first served'. In programming we prefer the phrase 'First
		in, first out'.</p>

		<p>Looking at the concept of a queue, we notice three things. We have a
		front position, i.e. the next object to be served, and end of queue,
		and a preservation of the order in which objects are added to queue.
		This seems to lend itself to the idea of a list, which has a first
		position, index 0, and end to which we can add, using the append
		method, and preserves the order of the objects it contains.</p>

		<blockquote class='problem'>

			A small Chinese take out store has recently become very busy. They
			have asked you to write the software to control the order system.
			They have installed a computer monitor in the kitchen which they
			want to display orders to the kitchen staff as they are made, and
			which the kitchen staff can delete when they have been processed,
			and three tills at the front counter accepting orders. They want
			their counter staff to be able to punch in an order, have that
			order automatically assigned a number which will be printed on a
			receipt given to the customer, and the orders to be displayed in a
			list ordered oldest to newest on the kitchen monitor.

		</blockquote>

		<p>The above problem represents a perfect example of a queue. It also
		highlights the idea that queues are most often used as a way of passing
		messages between multiple programs, e.g. three copies of the same
		program each controlling the tills, the program controlling the kitchen
		display, and the server controlling the queue. For the moment we are
		going to focus on the server program, which must accept messages
		describing orders, accept messages indicating the next order has been
		prepared and is ready, and send messages to the kitchen display.</p>

		<h2>Implementing a Queue Using a List</h2>

		<p>As mentioned earlier, we could simply use a list to handle the
		queue. We're going to assume that we have one pipe available to which
		the till programs can write order messages of the form</p>

<pre class='listing'>
NEWORDER
item description (cost)
[item description (cost)]
[item description (cost)]
ENDORDER
</pre>

		<p>and that the display in the kitchen is connected directly to the
		server.</p>

<pre class='listing'>
#server.py: A small take out order queue server

def displayqueue():
    print "\n\n\n"
    for o in orderqueue:
        print o[0]
        for i in o[1]:
            print "\t%s"%i
            
ordernum = 1
<b>orderqueue = []</b>
pipe = open("orderpipe","r")

while True:
    line = pipe.readline()
    if line == "NEWORDER\n":
        order = []
        line = pipe.readline():
        while line != "ENDORDER\n":
            order.append(line.rstrip())
            line = pipe.readline()
        <b>orderqueue.append((ordernum, order))</b>
        ordernum += 1
        displayqueue()
    elif line == "PROCESSED":
        <b>del orderqueue[0]</b>
        displayqueue()
    else:
        print "Warning: ", line.rstrip()
</pre>

		<p>Ignoring all the auxiliary stuff, we see on the first line in bold,
		we start with an empty queue. The second line in bold is where we add
		an order, which we have formed into a tuple of order number and a list
		of the items the order is composed of, to the end of the queue. The
		third line in bold is where we pull the first item in queue out, once
		the kitchen has prepared it.</p>
