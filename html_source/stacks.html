		<h2>Last In, First Out</h2>

		<p>A stack is an order collection of objects which can only be operated
		on in two ways. We can add an object to the end of the collection,
		known as <strong>pushing an object onto the stack</strong>, or we can
		remove the last item on the stack, known as <strong>popping the
		stack</strong>. We can only inspect the last item on the stack too. The
		rest of the collection is hidden from us, strictly speaking, although
		this depends greatly on the implementation of the stack. The airport
		luggage example illustrates the working of a stack. The first person to
		check their baggage in finds that their baggage is the last available
		at the other end on the conveyor belt. Sometimes being late does pay
		off. In fact the baggage will come out in the reverse order it was put
		in.</p>

		<p>Stacks are one of those tools in every programmer's toolkit. Which
		is not to say they can solve every problem, but they are found in a
		surprising variety of solutions. The key concept to understand about a
		stack is that they are good for reordering things in a variety of ways,
		not just for reversing things. They are also good a 'remembering
		things' so they can be undone, hence the term 'undo stack'.</p>

		<h2>Lists as Stacks</h2>

		<p>Python offers us a convenient set of methods to operate lists as
		stacks.</p>

		<ul>

			<li><strong>Inspection</strong>: The simplest method in Python for
			inspecting the value on the top of the stack, is to index the -1th
			element, as in <code>&lt;list&gt;[-1]</code>.</li>

			<li><strong>Pushing</strong>: Fortunately the append method serves
			admirably the function of a stack push.</li>

			<li><strong>Popping</strong>: And Python provides us with a list
			method conveniently named 'pop', <code>&lt;list&gt;.pop()</code>,
			that removes the last value from the list and returns it.</li>

		</ul>

<pre class='listing'>
&gt;&gt;&gt; stack = []
&gt;&gt;&gt; stack.append(3)
&gt;&gt;&gt; stack
[3]
&gt;&gt;&gt; stack.append(2)
&gt;&gt;&gt; stack
[3, 2]
&gt;&gt;&gt; stack.append(1)
&gt;&gt;&gt; stack
[3, 2, 1]
&gt;&gt;&gt; stack.pop()
1
&gt;&gt;&gt; stack.pop()
2
&gt;&gt;&gt; stack.pop()
3
&gt;&gt;&gt;
</pre>

		<h2>Infix to Postfix Conversion: A Worked Example</h2>

		<p>There are various ways to write down an arithmetic expression. We
		are used to a method know as infix notation, called such because
		operator's are written in between operands. Infix notation suffers a
		severe drawback, in that the precedence of operators is implicit and
		changes the order of evaluation. Consider the expression '4*(2+3)'.  We
		cannot simply evaluate this expression from left to right. We want to
		change the order in which it is evaluated to match the order of
		precedence.  Order changing, sounds like a job for soooperr-stack!</p>

		<p>The other two notations are called prefix and postfix notation
		respectively. Prefix notation lists operators prior to their operands,
		whilst postfix lists operators after their respective operands. We
		would write the former expression as '*4+23' or '423+*' in prefix and
		postfix notation respectively. Although basically equivalent except for
		order, computer science has settled on postfix as a preferred method
		for evaluating expressions. Note that the precedence of the operators in
		in the post- and pre-fix notations does not need brackets to define a
		change in precedence. We can evaluate these expressions from left to
		right, as such in the case of prefix notation</p>

		<ol>

			<li>* indicates we must multiply the next two operands, and replace
			them and the operator with the resulting value</li>

			<li>4 is the first operand</li>

			<li>+ indicates we must add the next two operands and replace the
			operator and it's operands with the resulting value</li>

			<li>2 is the first operand of the plus</li>

			<li>3 is the second operand of the plus</li>

			<li>2+3 = 5, so we replace the +23 part with 5 yielding '*45'</li>

			<li>5 is the second operand of the multiply</li>

			<li>4*5 = 10, so we replace the *45 part with 20 yielding '20'
			which requires no further evaluation, as there are no more
			operators.</li>
		
		</ol>

		<p>Since it is trivial to evaluate a postfix (or prefix) expression, we
		want to write a function that converts an infix expression to a postfix
		one. For the sake of example, we shall only allow single digit numbers,
		and the binary operators '+', '-', '*', '/', and parentheses.</p>

<pre class='listing'>
def postfix(infix):
    operator_stack = []
    output_queue = ''

    for c in infix:
        if c.isdigit():
            output_queue += c
        elif c in ['+', '-', '*', '/']:
            while len(operator_stack) &gt; 0 
                    and operator_stack[len(operator_stack)-1] in ['*', '/'] 
                    and c in ['+', '-']:
                output_queue += operator_stack.pop()
            operator_stack.append(c)
        elif c == '(':
            operator_stack.append(c)
        elif c == ')':
            o = operator_stack.pop()
            while o != '(':
                output_queue += o
                o = operator_stack.pop()
    while len(operator_stack) &gt; 0:
        output_queue += operator_stack.pop()
    
    return output_queue
