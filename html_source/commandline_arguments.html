		<h2>Dealing With Shell Expansions</h2>

		<p>Running programs from the shell command line provides us a number of
		conveniences. Tab completion, parameter expansion, and shell expansion.
		Shell expansion refers to the fact that the shell (at least on *nix
		systems) expands various special characters. So the command
		<code>python my_prog.py *.txt</code> actually becomes (depending on
		directory contents) <code>python my_prog.py input1.txt input2.txt
		todo.txt</code>. Which means our program never sees '*.txt' as a
		command line argument in 'sys.argv'. This is actually quite useful to
		us as programmer's, since we don't have to interpret '*.txt' ourselves.
		However, it does mean that our programs frequently receive a variable
		number of command line arguments.</p>

		<p>Suppose we wanted to write a program that deals with many files. We
		want the user to be able to specify those filenames, that the program
		should operate on, conveniently. Specifying them on the command line is
		the easiest thing for both user and programmer. The user is in a
		familiar environment, the programmer gets a list of files that is easy
		to deal with, but possibly interspersed with other options. For
		example,</p>

		<blockquote class='problem'>

			Write a program that outputs the CG/AT ratio for each sequence in a
			given FastA file, for any number of FastA files specified from the
			command line. However, sometimes we only want to count the CG/AT
			ratio within coding regions, other times strictly outside of coding
			regions, and most often just overall. We write our program to
			recognise three options, '-e' (expressed i.e. within coding
			region), '-i' (intragenic, i.e. not expressed), and '-a' (all, i.e.
			the entire sequence). We want the user to be able to specify which
			files they list will be treated in which way, and allow them to do
			so by treating all files normally, unless they are preceded by an
			option flag, in which case all filenames following the option flag
			are treated accordingly.  Option flags are obviously mutually
			exclusive.

		</blockquote>

		<p>This is a great case study to consolidate the skills we have
		acquired so far. So let's start by stating the problem more
		formally.</p>

		<blockquote class='problem'>

			Write a program that accepts a list of filenames and/or option
			flags on the command line. Option flags may be one of '-e', '-i',
			or '-a'. For each filename specified, for each sequence in the
			file, if it is a FastA file, output the CG/AT ratio of; the entire
			sequence if the most recently preceding option flag was '-a',
			coding regions only if the most recent preceding option flag was
			'-e', or non-coding regions if the most recently specified option
			flag was '-i'.

		</blockquote>

		<p>Ahh, shorter and more precise already! Great! Let's start breaking
		it down into manageable chunks, <a href='data/cg-at-ratio.png'>using
		this diagram</a>.</p>

		<img src='images/cg-at-ratio.png' class='breakdown' alt="breakdown" />

		<p>The bit that this section is all about is at the bottom left. So
		far, we've been dealing with command line arguments statically,
		defining their placement, accepting specific numbers of them and
		dealing with them by their position. But what happens if the user wants
		to specify an option after a filename, or an option between filenames
		to change the way the second file, but not the first, is handled. For
		this, we must remember that 'sys.argv' is a <strong>list</strong>, and
		we can loop over it.</p>

		<pre class='listing'>
#!/usr/bin/python
#cgat-example.py

import sys

def show_cgat_ratio(filename):
    ...

option = 'all'
for arg in sys.argv[1:]:			#check each argument beyond the first
    if arg.startswith("-"):	  #this argument is an option flag
        if arg == '-e':
            option = 'expressed'
        elif arg == '-i':
            option = 'intragenic'
        elif arg == '-a':
            option = 'all'
        else:
            print >> sys.stderr, "%s is an invalid option"%(arg, )
            sys.exit(1)
    else:                     #this argument should be treated as a filename
        show_cgat_ratio(arg)
</pre>

		<h2>Religious Indoctrination</h2>

		<p>Unix, and thus Linux, is an operating system built for programmers,
		by programmers. As such it adheres to some fairly fundamental
		principles. *nix is also the primary environment in which
		bioinformaticists work, so knowing and understanding these philosophies
		is important.</p>

		<ol>

			<li>Programs should do one thing and do it well.</li>

			<li>Expect the output of your program to be used as input to
			another, unknown, program. Keep your output minimal, and
			clean.</li>

			<li>Aim to have working parts of your program ready as soon as
			possible, for testing. Be prepared to restart sections of your code
			from scratch, sometimes even your whole program.</li>

		</ol>

		<p>There's some <strong>highly recommend</strong> reading on these
		philosophies <a class="doclink"
