		<h2>The Philosophers Bun Fight</h2>

		<p>The Greek philosopher Plato proposed that there was a perfect world,
		an ideal world, in which were to be found the true forms of things. The
		true form of a horse would exist in that world, free of defects, and
		free of deviations from the <em>idea</em>(l) of a horse (known as the
		'exemplar'). Horses to be found on our world, he considered only pale
		reflections or poor quality imitations of the perfect horse. And thus
		the class was born. Plato's student Aristotle later challenged his
		mentor's theory, counter-proposing that instead ideal forms were
		distilled from our observations of common attributes of objects, e.g.
		the 'ideal' horse has four legs, a long nose, etc... because this is
		common to all horses. Thus the class was refined, and this is the
		concept of class that we use today in a mathematical sense. We say
		objects, which are individual instances, are members of a class, by
		virtue of the fact that the objects have particular attributes and
		behaviours. The story of Plato and Aristotle not only set the precedent
		for the discussion of classes, but also for grad-students thumbing
		their noses at their supervisor's work, stealing large quantities of
		it, and publishing a paper that completely repudiates it.</p>

		<h2>Classes and Instances</h2>

		<p>In programming, a class refers specifically to a data structure
		which has functions bound to it. More esoterically, a
		<strong>class</strong> defines a set of <strong>objects</strong> which
		have certain attributes, or data values, associated with them, and
		exhibit certain behaviours, i.e. have functions associated with them.
		Individual <strong>instances</strong> of a class can be created (or
		<strong>instantiated</strong>) in the form of objects.</p>

		<p>In Python we can define a class using the 'class statement', which
		looks similar to the 'def statement' used to define functions.</p>

<pre class='definition'>class &lt;class name&gt; (&lt;parent class&gt;):
    &lt;def statement&gt;
    [def statement]
    [...]
</pre>

		<p>The 'class name' is a name of our choosing, by which the class shall
		be known, and the 'parent class' is the name of another already defined
		class, indicating our newly defined class is a descendant or sub-class
		of the parent class. The class 'object' is the ultimate mother class
		from which all Python classes descend, so we can use 'object' in place
		of 'parent class' for our own class definitions.</p>

		<p>As an example, let's define a class 'Student'. We say that students
		have the following properties; a name, a field of study, a degree, a
		blood-alcohol level, an amount of time spent as a student, and an
		amount of time spent actually studying. The behaviours a person can
		exhibit are to study, which increases the amount of time spent as a
		student and the amount of time spent studying inversely proportionally
		to their current blood-alcohol level, and reduces their blood alcohol
		level. Persons can also goof off, which increases the amount of time
		spent studying, and increases blood alcohol level. Finally a student
		can graduate once they have accumulated enough months of actual study
		time, if they haven't accumulated too much time spent studying.</p>

<pre class='listing'>class Student(object):
    def __init__(self, name, field, degree):
        self.name = name
        self.field = field
        self.degree = degree
        self.time_as_student = 0
        self.time_studied = 0
        self.bloodalcohol = 0
    
    def study(self):
        self.time_as_student += 1
        self.time_studied += 1-self.bloodalcohol
        self.bloodalcohol -= 0.1
        if self.bloodalcohol &lt; 0:
            self.bloodalcohol = 0

    def goof_off(self):
        self.time_as_student += 1
        self.bloodalcohol += 0.1
        if self.bloodalcohol > 0.4:
            print "Hospitalised!"
            self.bloodalcohol = 0
            self.time_as_student += 3

    def graduate(self):
        if degree == "MSc":
            if self.time_as_student > 18:
                print "%s exceeded maximum time, FAIL!"%(self.name)
            elif self.time_studied > 12:
                print "%s graduates!"%(self.name)
            else:
                print "Keep studying %s"%(self.name)
        elif degree == "PhD":
            if self.time_as_student > 24:
                print "%s exceeded maximum time, FAIL!"%(self.name)
            elif self.time_studied > 18:
                print "%s graduates!"%(self.name)
            else:
                print "Keep studying %s"%(self.name)
</pre>

		<p>Wow, okay, that's a lot of new stuff. Looking at what we've done, we
		see from the first line that we are defining a new class called
		'Student' descended from 'object'. Inside, i.e. indented from the class
		definition, we see function definitions. The fact that these function
		definitions occur within a class definition makes these functions
		methods of the newly defined class. A method of a class is called using
		dot notation from an object of that class. We'll deal with this
		shortly.</p>

		<p>If we look at the first function definition, we see we've defined a
		method called '__init__'. Why the hell would we choose a name so
		cumbersome as '__init__'? The truth is, Python has chosen it for us.
		All classes in Python have some methods implicitly defined. These
		methods are for the most part are empty, be they can be redefined, as we do
		with '__init__' above. The method '__init__' is known as a
		<strong>constructor</strong>, meaning it is called every time an object
		of the class in question is created. Newly created objects in python
		have no attributes or properties, i.e. no variables within the object.
		We must create these attributes in the constructor, which is why we
		redefine it.</p>

		<p>Note how the first parameter of every method within a class is
		something called 'self'. The 'self' parameter refers to the object of
		the class that called the method. This allows a method to operate on
		only a particular objects attributes, and not get confused between
		multiple objects of the same class. Time for more example code.</p>

<pre class='listing'>james = Student("James", "Biochemistry", "MSc")
james.name += " Dominy"
james.goof_off()
</pre>

		<p>The above lines of code will create a new object (assigned to the
		variable 'james'). On the first line, the '__init__' function is called
		with the newly created object passed to the parameter self, meaning all
		those <code>self.</code> references refer to the newly created object.
		In the last line, when we call the 'goof_off' method. Note how we pass no
		parameters, but the method takes one parameter; This is because python
		implicitly passes the object calling the method as the self parameter,
		i.e. the self parameter is passed the object 'james'.</p>

		<p>There are a number of specially recognised method names, all of
		which begin and end with double underscores. They are called at various
		times, implicitly. Mostly they are used to define how new classes work
		with arithmetic operators like '+', '-', etc... but one other one
		stands out in importance: the '__del__' method. This method is called
		when the object is destroyed, garbage collected, or deleted, and is
		used to ensure the object cleans up after itself correctly, closing any
		files it opened, or database connections, etc...</p>

		<p>The '__repr__' function is called whenever the value of the object
		is required for printing. The '__repr__' method must return a string,
		and is generally used to return a nicely formatted list of the object's
		attributes and their current values.</p>

		<h2>Encapsulation</h2>

		<p>The four design principles of using classes and objects, a system
		commonly referred to as <strong>object oriented programming</strong>, are
		encapsulation, modularity, inheritance, and polymorphism.
		<strong>Encapsulation</strong> refers to the desire to hide certain
		implementation details from other parts of the program. For example if
		we define a class that stores a vector, we could choose a number of
		internal data structures to store said vector, three separate
		attributes accessed via dot notation, or a list, or a tuple, or even a
		dictionary. If we later choose to use a different storage structure, we
		would normally need to change many lines of code that reference that
		structure directly throughout our program. The principle of
		encapsulation is that we define some interface that does not change,
		using a class and a collection of methods to extract the data from
		objects of that class. We can then use objects all over our code, and
		if we later decide that dictionaries are in fact better than lists, we
		change this inside the class, not affecting the rest of our program,
		which is using the still unchanged interface of methods.</p>

		<h2>Modularity</h2>

		<p><strong>Modularity</strong> is an ideal that aids our laziness.
		Classes allow us to split up our programming into distinct sections.
		Once we've written a class, we can use that class over ad over in
		different code, much like a function in a module.  But better, if we
		write a class, we can test it without having to have a whole program
		surrounding it. Testing a class and determining that it works
		correctly, means that when we start writing code that uses that class
		that suddenly doesn't work, we know the bug is not in the class, but in
		the new code.</p>

		<h2>Inheritance</h2>

		<p><strong>Inheritance</strong> has two uses. Firstly it allows us to
		specify a relationship between two classes. Secondly, we can avoid
		duplicating code. For example, consider a mortal. We might define a
		mortal to exhibit various behaviours, represented by methods, and
		properties. Mortals die, and generally agonise over this fact, when
		their existential angst levels get too high. So we write two methods,
		called 'die' and 'agonise' in the class 'mortal'. But a student is a
		mortal too. A student has all the properties of mortals, and exhibits
		all the same behaviours. Instead of rewriting and redefining all these
		things for the class student, can can simply derive student from
		mortal. Now all students have all the properties and methods of a
		mortal, in addition to whatever additional stuff we define for a
		student.</p>

<pre class='listing'>class mortal(object):
    def __init__(self):
        self.angst = 0
    
    def agnonise(self):
        print "Oh... %w is me"%(", ".join(["woe"]*self.angst))

    def die(self):
        print "The salmon mouse!"

class Student(mortal):
    def __init__(self, name, field, degree):
        mortal.__init__(self)
        self.name = name
        self.field = field
        self.degree = degree
        self.time_as_student = 0
        self.time_studied = 0
        self.bloodalcohol = 0
    
    def study(self):
        self.time_as_student += 1
        self.angst += 0.1
        if self.angst > 1:
            print "Nervous break down"
            self.time_as_student += 6
            self.bloodalcohol = 0
            self.angst = 0
        else:
            self.time_studied += 1-self.bloodalcohol
            self.bloodalcohol -= 0.1
            if self.bloodalcohol &lt; 0:
                self.bloodalcohol = 0
        print "%s has studied %i months, and has %f angst points"%
              (self.name, self.time_studied, self.angst)

    def goof_off(self):
        self.time_as_student += 1
        self.bloodalcohol += 0.1
        self.angst -= 1
        if self.bloodalcohol > 0.6:
            self.die()
            return
        if self.bloodalcohol > 0.4:
            print "Hospitalised!"
            self.bloodalcohol = 0
            self.time_as_student += 3
        print ("%s has spent another month goofing off, and has %f angst points, "+
               "and a blood-alcohol of %f")%(self.name, self.angst, self.bloodalcohol)

    def graduate(self):
        if degree == "MSc":
            if self.time_as_student > 18:
                print "%s exceeded maximum time, FAIL!"%(self.name)
            elif self.time_studied > 12:
                print "%s graduates!"%(self.name)
            else:
                print "Keep studying %s"%(self.name)
        elif degree == "PhD":
            if self.time_as_student > 24:
                print "%s exceeded maximum time, FAIL!"%(self.name)
            elif self.time_studied > 18:
                print "%s graduates!"%(self.name)
            else:
                print "Keep studying %s"%(self.name)

Socrates = Student("Socrates", "Philosophy", "PhD")
Socrates.study()
Socrates.goof_off()
Socrates.study()
Socrates.die() #Socrates forced to take Hemlock

Aristotle = mortal()
Aristotle.study() #breaks because Aristotle isn't a student
</pre>

		<h2>Polymorphism</h2>

		<p><strong>Polymorphism</strong> is not as important to us in Python as
		it is in strictly typed languages. Python implements dynamic typing
		using something 'duck-typing', meaning if it looks like a duck, and
		acts like a duck, assume it's a duck. This is why we can pass many
		functions a tuple in place of list, and <i>vice versa</i>. Because a
		tuple looks like a list, i.e. it's a sequence of elements, and acts
		like a list, i.e. we extract individual elements from both tuples and
		lists in the same way, using <code>seq[index]</code>.</p>
