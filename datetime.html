		<h2>The Unix Epoch</h2>

		<p>Dates and times have been traditionally tricky for computers to
		handle, because of the complexities of the Gregorian calendar, let
		alone taking into account the existence of non-western cultural
		calendars. The solution was to find something standard, common to every
		calendar, and easy to manipulate. The second was chosen as the standard
		unit of time in programming, and in the UNIX world a fixed standard
		time was named, the UNIX epoch, being 00:00am 1<sup>st</sup> January,
		1970. (The year UNIX was first released). Other operating systems use a
		different epoch. The reason for this, is that practically every
		application of arithmetic to times or dates involves breaking down the
		date or time in question to a value in seconds, and then converting it
		back. Both conversion to and from seconds, and finally into a nice
		human readable representation are common practice in programming,
		tedious, and thus already solved by someone else in the form of the <a
		class='doclink' href=
		'http://docs.python.org/lib/module-time.html'>time module</a>.</p>

		<h2>Using the time Module</h2>

		<p>Whilst there are many functions available in the time modules, three
		are of primary importance, ignoring the complexities of locales and
		timezones. Obviously the first thing we need to do is to import the
		module...</p>

		<pre class='listing'>
&gt;&gt;&gt; import time
&gt;&gt;&gt;
</pre>

		<ul>

			<li><code>time.time()</code> returns the number of seconds since
			the epoch, where the epoch is system dependant. On some systems, a
			floating point number is returned, in which the non-integer portion
			of the number represents sub-second precision.</li>

			<li>

				<code>time.localtime([seconds])</code> converts 'seconds' if
				given, otherwise the value returned by time.time(), into a
				tuple of 9 values, broken down as follows. Note that the tuple
				returned can be accessed using dot notation and the attribute
				name, as well as by index subscription.<br />

				<br />

				<table cellspacing='0'>
					<caption>Contents of time.localtime() tuple.</caption>

						<tr>
							<th>Index</th>

							<th>Attribute</th>

							<th>Values</th>
						</tr>
					</thead>

					<tbody>
						<tr>
							<td><tt>0</tt></td>

							<td><tt>tm_year</tt></td>

				</table><br />
			</li>

			<li>

				<code>time.strftime(format[, t])</code> returns a string that
				formats the tuple given in 't', or the tuple returned by
				time.localtime() if 't' is not given, as per the string
				'format'. 't', if given, must be a tuple matching the structure
				of one returned by time.localtime(). The 'format' string will
				be returned as is, except that '%' specifiers will be replaced
				as indicated by the following table.<br />
